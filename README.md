# Minesweeper

Basic Minesweeper game implemented in ReactJS.

Node needed to run. Once installed, run program using:
```$ npm start```

This will automatically open up a browser where you will be able to play the game.

Note, standard rules apply to this version of Minesweeper with two exceptions:
* The first click is not guaranteed safe. Mines are set when instance of game is set.
* The "Reveal Mines" button was implemented per project specifications. This is not a standard feature in Minesweeper.
